<h2>The Ministry</h2>
<h3>Elections</h3>
<p>
    Ministers are elected on the 1st of each month with 1 week of campaigning time before the results are announced.
    All elections will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Instant-runoff voting</a>.
</p>

    choose to extend their term by 1 month through a unanimous vote and then royal assent.
</p>
<h5>Budgets</h5>

    When the term has been extended, the royalty may choose to increase the budgets of ministers.
</p>
<h3>Impeachment of ministers</h3>
<p>
    If a minister is not doing their job another minister may start an impeachment against them after royal assent if
    all non-involved
    ministers agree a vote is sent to the general population
    if there is a majority, that minister is removed and the candidate from the last election with the next highest vote
    will fill the spot.
</p>

<p>
    If the royalty agrees that a minister is doing more harm than good or has committed misconduct that minister may be
    removed without a vote.
</p>
<h3>Reimbursement</h3>
<p>
    If a minister keeps good financial records including: what they purchased, how much it cost, rationale, where/who
    they bought it from, date, approximate time and proof of purchase, they may apply for reimbursement up to their
    budget for the term during campaigning for the next term or within 24 hours after resignation, each minister may
    only request reimbursement once per term.
    A minister's budget is decided at the beginning of their term.
</p>
<h3>Loans</h3>
<p>
    If a minister can't afford to do their duties they may apply for a loan when running for ministry and after the term
    has been extended until the end of the month, loans will be granted on the first day of a month or when a member of
    royalty is able to join EarthMC after the first of the month; this loan must be paid back during the campaigning
    period for the next term or within 24 hours after resigning. If a minister can't afford to buy something that they
    need to perform their duties, they may ask a member of the royalty to give them a small loan out of the nation's
    bank to make a single purchase, this may be done as often as the minister wants as long as there is enough room in
    their budget. Reimbursement will be subtracted from what a minister owes from a ministerial loan if they have a
    loan.
</p>
<h3>Lack of ministers</h3>
<p>
    In the event that not enough people run in an election or a minister is impeached with no candidate to replace them
    their duty will be fulfilled by the royalty.
</p>
